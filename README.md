# Full Stack Nanodegree program

##  Project Overview

This repository is a collection of projects I built for [Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004). The program covers server-side web applications using relational database to store data. 

## Projects

 1. [Logs Analysis](https://github.com/ivelisousa/Full-Stack-Nanodegree/tree/master/Log-analysis)  
> The program you write in this project will run from the command line. It won't take any input from the user. Instead, it will connect to that database, use SQL queries to analyze the log data, and print out the answers to some questions.
 2. Item Catalog   

> You will develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post,  edit and delete their own items.

 - Linux Server Configuration
> You will take a baseline installation of a Linux server and prepare it to host your web applications. You will secure your server from a number of attack vectors, install and configure a database server, and deploy one of your existing web applications onto it.
